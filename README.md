# Canvas

**(in progress)**

Canvas is a 2D concept game in which you drive a spaceship and shoot at things over a grid of coloured squares.

All the user actions change the colours of the tiles of the grid.

The catch being that each tile is actually a pixel of a larger bitmap which has been scaled up.
The idea is to have the players generate abstract art pieces by playing the game.
